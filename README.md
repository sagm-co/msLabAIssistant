# ***msLabAIssistant* ML Models**

msLabAIssistant is a Python-based software platform that integrates inference models for multiple identification properties and uses them for compound identification through suspect and non-target screening approaches.

This repository provides datasets and Jupyter notebooks supporting ML models developed for the QuEChERS–HPLC–ESI–HRMS workflow, including retention time inference (XGBoost), methodological amenability (Random Forest), probability prediction of protonated or deprotonated species (Random Forest), and chromatographic signal quality assessment (Random Forest). Each notebook documents its training set.
